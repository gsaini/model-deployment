# Machine Learning - Model Deployment

Model Deployment is the process of **making a trained model available for use** in a production environment.  
This involves:

1. Saving (serializing) the trained model.
2. Setting up an interface (like an API) for external systems to send data.
3. Hosting the model on servers, cloud, or edge devices.
4. Ensuring continuous performance through monitoring and retraining.

**Types of Deployment:**

- **Online (Real-time)** — Immediate prediction responses (e.g., chatbots, recommendation engines).
- **Offline (Batch)** — Periodic processing of large data sets (e.g., nightly analytics jobs).
